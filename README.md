Attention! Important hint:

This time with the update, please proceed as follows:

Please save old settings externally. Then delete the old extensiuon completely and also delete the work data.

This is necessary because the module structure has changed. The old ACP module must first be completely removed and then the extension can be reinstalled. Then simply upload the data and install.

After the installation, simply enter the old data again.
